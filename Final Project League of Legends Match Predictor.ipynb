    "### Step 5: Visualization and Interpretation  \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization tools like confusion matrices and ROC curves provide insights into the model's performance. The confusion matrix helps in understanding the classification accuracy, while the ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion Matrix : A Confusion Matrix is a fundamental tool used in classification problems to evaluate the performance of a model. It provides a matrix showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model, categorized by the actual and predicted classes.\n",
    "Where \n",
    "-  True Positive (TP): Correctly predicted positive class (class 1).\n",
    "- True Negative (TN): Correctly predicted negative class (class 0).\n",
    "- False Positive (FP): Incorrectly predicted as positive (class 1), but the actual class is negative (class 0). This is also called a Type I error.\n",
    "- False Negative (FN): Incorrectly predicted as negative (class 0), but the actual class is positive (class 1). This is also called a Type II error. \n",
    "\n",
    "ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve):\n",
    "The ROC Curve is a graphical representation used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model across all classification thresholds. It plots two metrics:\n",
    "- True Positive Rate (TPR) or Recall (Sensitivity)-It is the proportion of actual positive instances (class 1) that were correctly classified as positive by the model.\n",
    "- False Positive Rate (FPR)-It is the proportion of actual negative instances (class 0) that were incorrectly classified as positive by the model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "AUC: \n",
    "AUC stands for Area Under the Curve and is a performance metric used to evaluate the quality of a binary classification model. Specifically, it refers to the area under the ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), which plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) versus the False Positive Rate (FPR) for different threshold values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification Report:\n",
    "A Classification Report is a summary of various classification metrics, which are useful for evaluating the performance of a classifier on the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 5:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Write code to visualize the model's performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves. Generate classification reports to evaluate precision, recall, and F1-score. Retrain the model with L2 regularization and evaluate the performance.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Task 6: Save and load the trained model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This task demonstrates the techniques to persist a trained model using `torch.save` and reload it using `torch.load`. Evaluating the loaded model ensures that it retains its performance, making it practical for deployment in real-world applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Saving the Model:\n",
    "- Save the model's learned weights and biases using torch.save().( e.g. , torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'your_model_name.pth'))\n",
    "- Saving only the state dictionary (model parameters) is preferred because it’s more flexible and efficient than saving the entire model object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loading the Model:\n",
    "- Create a new model instance (e.g., `model = LogisticRegressionModel()`) and load the saved parameters. ( e.g. , `model.load_state_dict(torch.load('your_model_name.pth'))`)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluating the Loaded Model:\n",
    "   - After loading, set the model to evaluation mode by calling `model.eval()\n",
    "   - After loading the model, evaluate it again on the test dataset to make sure it performs similarly to when it was first trained..Now evaluate it on the test data.\n",
    "   - Use `torch.no_grad()` to ensure that no gradients are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 6:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Write code to save the trained model and reload it. Ensure the loaded model performs consistently by evaluating it on the test dataset.  \n"

    "#### Task 7: Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best learning rate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By testing different learning rates, you will identify the optimal rate that provides the best test accuracy. This fine-tuning is crucial for enhancing model performance . \n",
    "1. Define Learning Rates:\n",
    "   - Choose these learning rates to test ,[0.01, 0.05, 0.1]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reinitialize the Model for Each Learning Rate:\n",
    "  - For each learning rate, you’ll need to reinitialize the model and optimizer e.g.(`torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr)`).\n",
    "   - Each new learning rate requires reinitializing the model since the optimizer and its parameters are linked to the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Train the Model for Each Learning Rate:\n",
    "  - Train the model for a fixed number of epochs (e.g., 50 or 100 epochs) for each learning rate, and compute the accuracy on the test set.\n",
    "  - Track the test accuracy for each learning rate and identify which one yields the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluate and Compare:\n",

    "\n",
    "The code to evaluate feature importance to understand the impact of each feature on the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1.Extracting Model Weights:\n",
    "  - The weights of the logistic regression model represent the importance of each feature in making predictions. These weights are stored in the model's linear layer (`model.linear.weight`).\n",
    " - You can extract the weights using `model.linear.weight.data.numpy()` and flatten the resulting tensor to get a 1D array of feature importances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Creating a DataFrame:\n",
    " - Create a pandas DataFrame with two columns: one for the feature names and the other for their corresponding importance values (i.e., the learned weights).\n",
    " - Ensure the features are aligned with their names in your dataset (e.g., `X_train.columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sorting and Plotting Feature Importance:\n",
    "  - Sort the features based on the absolute value of their importance (weights) to identify the most impactful features.\n",
    "  - Use a bar plot (via `matplotlib`) to visualize the sorted feature importances, with the feature names on the y-axis and importance values on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interpreting the Results:\n",
    "  - Larger absolute weights indicate more influential features. Positive weights suggest a positive correlation with the outcome (likely to predict the positive class), while negative weights suggest the opposite.\n",

    "Congratulations on completing the project! In this final project, you built a logistic regression model to predict the outcomes of League of Legends matches based on various in-game statistics. This comprehensive project involved several key steps, including data loading and preprocessing, model implementation, training, optimization, evaluation, visualization, model saving and loading, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis. This project provided hands-on experience with the complete workflow of developing a machine learning model for binary classification tasks using PyTorch.\n",
